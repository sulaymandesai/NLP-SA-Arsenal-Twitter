"Wenger 1254 games= 51% of wins ..... Unai Emery is 22 unbeaten, 11 wins in a row, the last time Arsenal made such a record, was in 1987 under Graham who won 14 games, 3rd best PL's attack, 8th best European attack, 12p won against Top 5, season before(Wenger) only 6p +++++

"So I was right for a long time, While Unai Emery had just achieved a better season than the last 2 Wenger's seasons and a European final that Arsenal haven't played since at least 2006,  1.85p/match, 50 first games=32 wins, 1st in Arsenal history, 78 games=55.1% of wins,

"Arsenal were entirely irrelevant and still won, Liverpool could have been playing Fleetwood and we still would have lost this game.

This one was more worrying but I genuinely think this doesn’t happen if we were chasing the league still.

The lads were truly on the beach 🏖"
"2 shots on target, 2 goals is the type of shit you expect from FIFA but this was far worse. Van Dijk and Alisson of all people with 2 howlers and Arsenal got 2 of the most charitable goals all season."
"Arsenal had 33% possession at home which is probably the lowest they’ve ever had at home in the PL era

For reference they managed 33% AWAY to Man City with 10 men 

They had 3 shots in total in the game less than any other game this season  but equal to their 10 men at City"
"Lost away to Arsenal.

Losing away to Arsenal used to be a regular occurrence for any team, with their silky style of play they could have your pants down in minutes.

This wasn’t that game, Arsenal were so bad we may as well have been watching a Pulis West Brom"

One thing that's really interesting about Arsenal is how they slowly but surely built towards their final form (The Invincibles) through shrewd transfer recruitment in the early 2000s. It's a little bit like what Liverpool did from 2015-18 where lots of things went right for them

That £250k a week is only his take home. His pre-tax salary is closer to £400k a week. There’s basically no way Arsenal can afford to employ him unless he’s playing for 2/3rd paycut (or more). Should not be going anywhere near Coutinho. https://t.co/asLkD1UzRF

Subs: Macey, Holding, Sokratis, Kolasinac, Torreira, Smith, Willock, Nelson, Saka."
Lowkey think arsenal will make a game out of this. Not gonna be a whitewash
Just look at Arsenal squad for God sake.
"Has anyone ever correctly predicted a Mikel Arteta starting 11? Can't believe Saka has missed out but there may be things we don't know. Best of luck Arsenal, you may need it"
I don’t think it’s a countinho motive honestly. He hasn’t been the same since he left liverpool and Arsenal can’t afford a hit and miss midfielder atm

The Ozil situation makes me sad. I honestly think he committed because he likes Arsenal. We've craved a player to pledge their future to us rather than jump ship and now fans abuse him. It's not his fault he got offered 350k.

"Can’t even lie, Arsenal is going to be a problem next season. Not for us, but for other teams. Their press is looking well-oiled and with the pace and talent up front, they can make anything happen. If they get better CBs, they can easily take a CL spot next season."
Is still have a feeling ARSENAL would beat MANCITY.....

Is the FA Cup sponsored by Emirates? Is Arsenal Football Cub sponsored by Emirates? I'm just asking.

Arsenal actually restricted Man City to just 1 shot on target last night? A team that has scored 137 goals in all competitions this season. 

With Mustafi &amp; Luiz in the same backline 😭. Arteta is a genius. Imagine what he will do when he gets proper defenders"

Good morning to everyone except Man U &amp; Arsenal fans
When I started going to the Arsenal in the early 80s we were a top 6 side at best. But I loved something about the club. I've been lucky to see some great players &amp; moments. We dont have any divine right to win anything &amp; it's not the reason I fell in love with this club.
Arsenal surprised me last night 👏🏽👏🏽
that arsenal performance was beautiful man
"also yes this is pretty much the russian arsenal-city, down to the colours"
#ARSMCI The real game will be replayed tomorrow at nakivubo stadium...refute the rumours being spread by arsenal fans that arsenal won by 2 goals https://t.co/1BnuWpTYfN
But that first goal is exactly how city score goals..!! I think Arsenal had about 8 touches in their box before they scored. https://t.co/CE8kWwoAAF
"So let me get this right.. when Chelsea parked the bus under Mourinho, arsenal fans abused our style of play and said our title wins were awful blah blah blah yeah? But now suddenly 60% possession and 7 shots in TWO games is an Arteta masterclass?? Joke fanbase man"
I love the Arsenal community vibes rn but let’s not get ahead of our selves and say we have won the FA cup already 😂😭 I’m getting Baku vibes 🤦🏿‍♂️
If Man United end up beating us today and the FA Cup final is Arsenal vs United I’m unfollowing every fucking South Asian on twitter for the final only because I know Asian twitter is gonna have a field day

"Of course, they could lay an egg against Crystal Palace.  Wolves could win their last 2 matches and Arsenal could win FA Cup.  I believe the most likely scenario is Tottenham ending up in 6th place if they win last 2 matches."

Whilst Pearson probably isn’t the man for the long term he should at least see out the last 2 games. Who else is going to come in and get a result at City and Arsenal with the same personnel?! What a ridiculous time to decide change. Can’t stand this
I won’t lie it could be a nostalgia thing but I don’t like seeing people diss Viera and I’m not even an arsenal fan
Watford have picked up decent points in the last few weeks and they have 2 games left against City and Arsenal and then deceive to replace Pearson as manager! 😂 Bonkers really but I will take it as an #avfc fan. Think the board at Watford have just relegated themselves

Did you know Arsenal is in the FA Cup Final? Just saying 😋
Ridiculous decision. Why would they sack a manager who has survived relegation before with Leicester whilst they have 2 games left.

Bournemouth should try and a get a point today or 3points today .. There is still hope"

Does it change the fact we need to win atleast 1 game? No.

Arteta quietly starting to do a really good job at Arsenal

Bournemouth have to win away at Everton and also hope Watford are beaten very well."
Arsenal wanted to make sure their player was healthy oh god the horror can you imagine. Give me a fucking break https://t.co/ohZnLawNup

Oh Bournemouth. Their only light at the end of the tunnel now is that Watford have to play Man City then Arsenal. Still Everton away won't be easy

A draw against Arsenal could be massive #avfc
"Bournemouth need to win at Everton and hope that Watford lose to Manchester City and Arsenal, and by a few goals. 

It’s not impossible."
Arsenal are forming winning run they better win Watford cos I can’t even contain myself anymore.. how can a good football side go down like this😒
If we get a point at arsenal we have a massive chance to stay up against west ham #AVFC
"I think thats Bournemouth gone, their only hope a Watford hammering by City and Arsenal, Villa defeats and a last day win for them at Goodison."
So Bournemouth need Watford to get beat by Arsenal and City (not unlikely) but also to go to Goodison and win? Eek.

Out of the remaining fixtures (Watford+AV) the only 'winnable' games are both for AV.

-Arsenal have won 4/18 away games in the PL this season
-15th place West Ham who are now safe."
"Remaining fixtures:
Watford:
Man City (H)
Arsenal (A)

B'mouth:
Everton (A)

Aston Villa:
Arsenal (H)
West Ham (A)"

Watford aren’t getting any points from City and Arsenal. Bournemouth’s last game is against us! We either relegate Bournemouth or relegate Watford and I’m not sure which I’d prefer if I’m honest!
Tonight we smash Chelsea. And then arsenal easy pickings fam.
"We get something from Arsenal, we have a chance 🙉 #AVFC"
Arsenal and MAn City better win Watford and save Bournemouth cos this life is not fair at all... absolutely gutted for Eddie Howe rn #BOUSOU
Got to feel for Bournemouth but they deserve that for being ahead of us alphabetically at the beginning of the season despite their “A” standing for Athletic which should follow Arsenal alphabetically.
It be great if we did the treble over Chelsea this season and beat them for the 3rd time. But I just don't see it happening. They gotta win at least once. Then it will be arsenal v… https://t.co/fNzujX2sg3

Can I just say arsenal winning last night and Hamilton Hungaroaring is just beyond incredible. 🙌
Fancy Aston Villa to stay up now of they keep the Arsenal score respectable and win West Ham. Watford gonna get smoked and Bournemouth have just gave away their best opportunity
I’m so happy arsenal won
"Bournemouth have to go to Goodison Park and win on the final day, and hope Watford lose to Man City and Arsenal, and that Villa only take 3pts max from Arsenal and West Ham. That second Southampton goal has really hurt their goal diff though"

•Capitalised on lapses in City's high line
•Brilliant Arsenal defensive organisation in 2nd half
•Tactic of using Sterling as a link worked well
•But City need to buy an additional quick wide threat"
"• As we said in our tactical analysis thread of the City Arsenal match a few weeks ago, Auba made many intelligent runs in-behind City's high defensive line, but they simply weren't supplied. However, Tierney certainly learnt from this for the 2nd goal!

- here even Pepe has dropped into the deep defensive block to block the pass into Sterling in this inside left position, to cover for Bellerin who has to track Mendy https://t.co/N9a7rnC4it"
"- this meant that City's CBs now had an additional passing option to find. And with Mendy overlapping quite aggressively, Bellerin was detracted from coming inside and getting very tight to Sterling 
- Sterling then used his dribbling ability to turn &amp; run at Arsenal's defence https://t.co/hob5cF07g9"
•A solution for City may have been Sterling using his pace to make runs in-behind Arsenal's defence for Laporte/Garcia to find with long passes - there was just one pass of this type in the first half https://t.co/8Eaz5N5AZI

Five Things We Learnt From Arsenal FA Cup Win Over Man City https://t.co/CevCug7ysj
"• When Arsenal's build-up was patient, it was vital to have a link from their deeper build-up to the attack
- it now seems Arteta prefers Lacazette's superior link-up play to Nketiah's energy
- he played a big part in the first goal, dropping deep to receive the ball off Tierney https://t.co/AM7xtDrb6m"
"There is no doubt arsenal lads are world class players. The reason why they were playing terrible before was simply their mentality. Asking how is like calling their feat a 'miracle' it wasn't a miracle, it was possible all along https://t.co/E4j8bvwCg1"
"•This quicker circulation of the ball from the CBs also benefitted Arsenal in transition,from a chance creation POV
- for example for Auba's early one-on-one chance, Luiz wins the ball back &amp; immediately fires the pass into him meaning Auba can breach City's high line https://t.co/6yJqojc6L5"
"- direct improvement on the issues we noted with Guendouzi not showing for the ball in these kind of build-up situations, in our tactical analysis thread of Man City 3-0 Arsenal. 
- Xhaka was particularly immaculate in possession - completing 28/30 passes https://t.co/IRVS7hvbct"
"- however, when the speed of Arsenal's ball circulation improved, as did their ability to break through Arsenal's press
- this was also particularly helped by Xhaka &amp; Ceballos constantly showing for the ball in tight spaces &amp; being able to turn away from pressure https://t.co/3iCcqvXpir"
"1st half

•Pep employed a very high press on Arsenal's 3 CBs
- there were a few occasions where it resulted in City recovering the ball in dangerous areas,mainly when Arsenal's CBs took too long to build play instead of finding a pass into midfield, thus inviting the high press https://t.co/LUEfdhARDI"

I’m sorry but why would you sack a manager with your last 2 games being Man City and Arsenal when you need to stay up. Surely can’t be true
"Had Bournemouth won today, they may have fancied their chances of staying up. Watford have two difficult games remaining. Aston Villa also have to play Arsenal, but that game against West Ham on the final day perhaps a bit easier now WH pretty much safe."
"The Spurs season will end with us doing everything right for UEFA and Arsenal winning FA cup to take our place. Just how our luck is.

Arsenal v Manchester United inshallah
Arsenal can beat Liverpool and Man City in less then a week but no doubt they're gonna lose to Villa
"Bournemouth draw there would have meant they'd still need to beat Everton on the final day. 3 points &amp; 4 behind Watford on goal differential but Watford still play City and Arsenal. Meanwhile, Villa need 3 points from games vs. Arsenal &amp; West Ham right now (even now on GD w/Bou)"
"Apparently it’s goals scored. This means that the only way Bournemouth go up is if they beat Everton by 2 goals or more to stay up... and hope that Watford get 0 points against Arsenal and City.

Still very possible for an escape."
Draw to Man City Tuesday and anything other than a win from Villa against Arsenal and we’re safe

Watford needa draw against City to stay up. Arsenal will definitely not lose to Villa at Villa park
"Bournemouth staying up still seems likely to me.

Man City will prbably put something like 10 past Watford. Then Arsenal will likely beat them as well.

Bournemouth have to win at Everton to stay up and Watford have to get battered by city and arsenal
"Yes up a place again without playing,  city to smash watford by 5 tuesday ,we beat arsenal and jump to 17th on gd ,id love to see it 😀. Then wrap it up with a win at West ham"

Eddie Howe and Bournemouth going out sad. I don't like it. Luckily for them Watford last 2 games is against City and Arsenal. Bournemouth need a huge win against Everton!
This honestly isn't the best example of Arsenal playing well yesterday from a 'how will we create sustainable results going forward' there were other best bits
"JustArsenal News At last we can all be proud to be a Gooner again https://t.co/DmsQ166HfA

Watford have city at home then arsenal away. Bournemouth and villa have to win and it’ll come down to goal difference
"If we beat Arsenal I would be confident in saying we will be playing in the PL next season.

Draw would also be decent and could still be enough as long as we beat West Ham.

It is going to be tight but everything is going our way.

#AVFC #UTV"
Tough way for Bournemouth to go down...need City and Arsenal to destroy Watford (for goal difference) and get 3 points on the final week. Can’t decide if it’s better for Bournemouth or Watford to stay in EPL.

"Watford sacked there manager, Bournemouth they have man city and arsenal just beat everton you can do it #BOUSOU"
"So that means if Watford get one more point at Man City, who has nothing to play for, they stay up. If they lose Tuesday, Bournemouth would need to win at Everton, have Watford lose at Arsenal, and have a higher goal difference. Pretty much the ball is in Watford’s court."
